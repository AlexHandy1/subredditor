   So that I can understand what people are searching for
   I want to be able to store user searches in a database

3. As a User,
   So that I understand why I don't get results,
   I want to see an informative error message

4. As a User,
   So that I don't see too many results,
   I only want to be able to filter the top 10 latest subreddit topics

5. As a User,
   So that I can search through the most recent subreddit articles,
   I want to be able to conduct a simple text search from the results list
